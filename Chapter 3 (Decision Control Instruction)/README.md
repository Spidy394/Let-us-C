is greater than its perimeter.  

1. Given three points  **(x1, y1), (x2, y2)** and **(x3, y3)**, write a program
to check if all the three points fall on one straight line.  

1. Given the coordinates (x, y) of center of a circle and its radius, write
a program that will determine whether a point lies inside the circle, on the circle or outside the circle.

        Hint: Use sqrt( ) and pow( ) functions

1. Given a point **(x, y)**, write a program to find out if it lies on the X
axis, Y-axis or on the origin.
